# PowDB Release Targets

Every PowDB release ships to the following registries and platforms.
When cutting a release, follow the checklist at the bottom.

> **Current release: v0.9.0** (Throughput release: **WAL group commit** — overlapping Full-mode committers share one covering fsync, no durability-semantics change — plus **server read-ahead batching** for pipelining clients (one durability settlement per burst, replies in frame order) and TS-client **`execScript`** (statement-aware pipelined scripts, `transactional: true` all-or-nothing mode) and **eager connect** (first query rides behind the handshake). Measured locally: pipelined 500-insert burst ~250/s → ~16,000/s; 8 concurrent connections ~250/s → ~1,000/s; lone sequential committer unchanged. On-disk formats unchanged — 0.8.x databases/backups open as-is. Durability-failure replies are now explicit (`WAL durability sync failed: …`) instead of the generic error. `@zvndev/powdb-sync` remains beta-gated and NOT published to npm.).
> **v0.4.1, v0.4.2, and v0.4.3 are yanked** for crash-recovery data-loss bugs;
> 0.4.4 fixed them and added a standing durability regression suite. See
> `CHANGELOG.md`.

## Registries

| Target | Package | Registry URL |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| **crates.io** | `powdb-storage` | https://crates.io/crates/powdb-storage |
| **crates.io** | `powdb-auth` | https://crates.io/crates/powdb-auth |
| **crates.io** | `powdb-query` | https://crates.io/crates/powdb-query |
| **crates.io** | `powdb-backup` | https://crates.io/crates/powdb-backup |
| **crates.io** | `powdb-server` | https://crates.io/crates/powdb-server |
| **crates.io** | `powdb` (embedded facade — in-process Rust API) | https://crates.io/crates/powdb |
| **crates.io** | `powdb-cli` | https://crates.io/crates/powdb-cli |
| **crates.io** | `powdb-sync` (experimental — embedded-sync substrate; the companion npm package `@zvndev/powdb-sync` is **not yet published**) | https://crates.io/crates/powdb-sync |
| **npm** | `@zvndev/powdb-client` | https://www.npmjs.com/package/@zvndev/powdb-client |
| **npm** | `@zvndev/powdb-embedded` (in-process Node addon; prebuilt binaries for macOS arm64, Linux x64-gnu, Linux arm64-gnu — no source fallback, other targets are unsupported) | https://www.npmjs.com/package/@zvndev/powdb-embedded |
| **ghcr.io** | `ghcr.io/zvn-dev/powdb` (Docker image, `latest` + `vX.Y.Z` tags) | https://github.com/orgs/ZVN-DEV/packages |

## GitHub Releases

| Artifact | Platforms |
|----------|-----------|
| `powdb-cli-linux-x86_64` | Linux x86_64 |
| `powdb-server-linux-x86_64` | Linux x86_64 |
| `powdb-cli-macos-aarch64` | macOS ARM64 |
| `powdb-server-macos-aarch64` | macOS ARM64 |

These two platforms (Linux x86_64, macOS ARM64) are the **only** prebuilt
`powdb-cli` / `powdb-server` binaries. All other targets — Windows, Intel macOS,
Linux ARM64 — build from source (`cargo install` / `cargo build --release`).
Binary artifacts are built automatically by `.github/workflows/release.yml`
when a `v*` tag is pushed.

## Crate Publish Order

Inter-crate dependencies require publishing in this order:

1. `powdb-storage` (no inter-crate deps)
2. `powdb-auth` (no inter-crate deps)
3. `powdb-query` (depends on storage)
4. `powdb-sync` (experimental — depends on storage)
5. `powdb-backup` (depends on storage + sync; query is dev-only)
6. `powdb-server` (depends on storage + query + auth + sync)
7. `powdb` (embedded facade — depends on storage + query + sync)
8. `powdb-cli` (depends on storage + query + server + backup + auth + sync)

Non-publishable crates (`publish = false`): `powdb-compare`, `powdb-bench`, `powdb-query-fuzz`.

## Publishing is token-less (Trusted Publishing / OIDC)

Both registries publish from CI with **no stored token** — neither
`CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN` nor an npm token exists anymore. The workflows mint
short-lived credentials from their GitHub OIDC identity. This is configured once
per package/crate on the registry websites; see
[`docs/ci/trusted-publishing.md`](docs/ci/trusted-publishing.md) for the
one-time setup and the reusable standard.

- **crates.io** — `publish.yml` (manual `workflow_dispatch`, `dry_run=false`),
  authenticated via `rust-lang/crates-io-auth-action`. Kept manual because
  publishing to crates.io is irreversible.
- **npm (`@zvndev/powdb-client`)** — published automatically by `release.yml`
  on a `v*` tag push, with provenance. No manual `npm publish`, no token to make.
- **npm (`@zvndev/powdb-embedded`)** — published by `publish-node-addon.yml`
  (manual `workflow_dispatch`). It first builds the native addon on a per-platform
  runner matrix (macOS arm64, Linux x64/arm64; Intel macOS builds from source and
  Windows is deferred, both since the macos-13 runner retired in #149), then
  publishes one fat package bundling all three prebuilt `.node` binaries,
  token-less with provenance. `dry_run=true` (the default) packs every platform
  without publishing. Kept manual because the binary matrix is slow and the
  package is released on demand, not on every `v*` tag.

## Release Checklist

```
[ ] Update workspace version in root Cargo.toml
[ ] Update inter-crate dep versions in query/sync/backup/server/powdb/cli Cargo.toml
[ ] Update clients/ts/package.json version and clients/ts/src/index.ts CLIENT_VERSION
[ ] Update bindings/node/package.json version (@zvndev/powdb-embedded, lockstep)
[ ] Update CHANGELOG.md and the Current release line in RELEASES.md
[ ] Run bash scripts/check-version-consistency.sh
[ ] Run bash scripts/smoke-package.sh (npm pack/import smoke + cargo package list)
[ ] Commit: "chore: release vX.Y.Z"
[ ] cargo publish -p powdb-storage
[ ] cargo publish -p powdb-auth
[ ] cargo publish -p powdb-query
[ ] cargo publish -p powdb-sync   # experimental (depends on storage)
[ ] cargo publish -p powdb-backup
[ ] cargo publish -p powdb-server
[ ] cargo publish -p powdb       # embedded facade (depends on storage + query + sync)
[ ] cargo publish -p powdb-cli
[ ] git tag vX.Y.Z && git push origin vX.Y.Z
[ ] Verify GitHub Release workflow creates binaries AND auto-publishes npm
    (@zvndev/powdb-client) token-less via release.yml — no manual npm publish
[ ] Smoke-test the installed crates.io binary: run the README's documented
    PowQL flow, then kill -9 the server and restart to confirm WAL replay
    recovers the data (v0.4.1–v0.4.3 shipped data-loss P0s that the
    pre-publish gates missed because none exercised a real crash + restart)
[ ] Publish the embedded Node addon: run publish-node-addon.yml with
    dry_run=true to validate the full platform matrix, then re-run with
    dry_run=false to publish @zvndev/powdb-embedded (token-less, provenance).
    First-ever release of this name needs a one-time bootstrap `npm publish`
    + trusted-publisher config — see docs/ci/trusted-publishing.md
```
