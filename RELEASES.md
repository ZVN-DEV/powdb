# PowDB Release Targets

Every PowDB release ships to the following registries and platforms.
When cutting a release, follow the checklist at the bottom.

> **Current release: v0.24.0.** The first-hour round: everything a new user meets in their first hour, audited from the outside by installing the published crates, running the published binaries, and following the README verbatim. The headline defect is a silent wrong answer that survived restarts. A materialized view's dirty marker lived in memory only, so a graceful shutdown or a crash reset every view to CLEAN over its pre-mutation contents and it served them from then on, wrong in both directions (a deleted row kept coming back, an inserted row never appeared) with nothing left on disk that could detect or repair it. `mark_dirty` now writes through to `views.bin` on the false-to-true transition. `upsert` wrote NULL into `unique auto` columns because its insert branch skipped auto-assignment. `--format json` returned strings over the wire and numbers embedded, so a script silently stopped matching the moment it was pointed at a server. `useradd` refused a data directory it had not created, `--exec`/`--exec-file` exited 1 on input that merely ended with a comment, and a typo'd subcommand silently created a database directory named after the typo. Five SQL constructs that PowDB does not implement (CASE, COALESCE, COUNT DISTINCT, CAST, window OVER) answered with parser noise instead of saying they are not supported yet. Behavior change: a read-only snapshot now refuses a stale materialized view rather than serving it, so operators must refresh before snapshotting. Every benchmark number in the README, the site, and `docs/powdb-vs-sqlite.md` was re-measured and republished; three rows had drifted, one of them in the wrong direction. LICENSE now ships inside all eight crate tarballs and the Node addon, and MSRV is declared on all eight rather than one.
> **v0.4.1, v0.4.2, and v0.4.3 are yanked** for crash-recovery data-loss bugs;
> 0.4.4 fixed them and added a standing durability regression suite. See
> `CHANGELOG.md`.

| **crates.io** | `powdb-cli` | https://crates.io/crates/powdb-cli |
| **crates.io** | `powdb-sync` (experimental, the embedded-sync substrate) | https://crates.io/crates/powdb-sync |
| **npm** | `@zvndev/powdb-client` | https://www.npmjs.com/package/@zvndev/powdb-client |

| **npm** | `@zvndev/powdb-embedded` (in-process Node addon; prebuilt binaries for macOS arm64, Linux x64-gnu, Linux arm64-gnu — no source fallback, other targets are unsupported) | https://www.npmjs.com/package/@zvndev/powdb-embedded |

## GitHub Releases

| Artifact | Platforms |
|----------|-----------|
| `powdb-cli-linux-x86_64` | Linux x86_64 |
| `powdb-server-linux-x86_64` | Linux x86_64 |
| `powdb-cli-macos-aarch64` | macOS ARM64 |
| `powdb-server-macos-aarch64` | macOS ARM64 |

These two platforms (Linux x86_64, macOS ARM64) are the **only** prebuilt
`powdb-cli` / `powdb-server` binaries. Intel macOS and Linux ARM64 have no
prebuilt binary but do build from source (`cargo install` / `cargo build
--release`).

**Windows is not supported and does not build from source.** The heap's
memory-mapped scan path (`crates/storage/src/heap.rs`) uses `libc::mmap` /
`libc::munmap` and `std::os::unix::io::AsRawFd` with no platform gate, so
`cargo check -p powdb-storage --target x86_64-pc-windows-msvc` fails to
compile. This is why `publish-node-addon.yml` also omits the
`x86_64-pc-windows-msvc` addon target. Do not tell Windows users to build from
source; there is nothing for them to build until the mmap path gains a Windows
backend.
Binary artifacts are built automatically by `.github/workflows/release.yml`
when a `v*` tag is pushed.

## Crate Publish Order

Inter-crate dependencies require publishing in this order:

1. `powdb-storage` (no inter-crate deps)
2. `powdb-auth` (no inter-crate deps)
3. `powdb-query` (depends on storage)
4. `powdb-sync` (experimental — depends on storage)
5. `powdb-backup` (depends on storage + sync; query is dev-only)
6. `powdb-server` (depends on storage + query + auth + sync)
7. `powdb` (embedded facade — depends on storage + query + sync)
8. `powdb-cli` (depends on storage + query + server + backup + auth + sync)

Non-publishable crates (`publish = false`): `powdb-compare`, `powdb-bench`, `powdb-query-fuzz`.

## Publishing is token-less (Trusted Publishing / OIDC)

Both registries publish from CI with **no stored token** — neither
`CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN` nor an npm token exists anymore. The workflows mint
short-lived credentials from their GitHub OIDC identity. This is configured once
per package/crate on the registry websites; see
[`docs/ci/trusted-publishing.md`](docs/ci/trusted-publishing.md) for the
one-time setup and the reusable standard.

- **crates.io** — `publish.yml` (manual `workflow_dispatch`, `dry_run=false`),
  authenticated via `rust-lang/crates-io-auth-action`. Kept manual because
  publishing to crates.io is irreversible.
- **npm (`@zvndev/powdb-client`)** — published automatically by `release.yml`
  on a `v*` tag push, with provenance. No manual `npm publish`, no token to make.
- **npm (`@zvndev/powdb-embedded`)** — published by `publish-node-addon.yml`
  (manual `workflow_dispatch`). It first builds the native addon on a per-platform
  runner matrix (macOS arm64, Linux x64/arm64; Intel macOS builds from source and
  Windows is deferred, both since the macos-13 runner retired in #149), then
  publishes one fat package bundling all three prebuilt `.node` binaries,
  token-less with provenance. `dry_run=true` (the default) packs every platform
  without publishing. Kept manual because the binary matrix is slow and the
  package is released on demand, not on every `v*` tag.

## Release Checklist

```
[ ] Update workspace version in root Cargo.toml
[ ] Update inter-crate dep versions in query/sync/backup/server/powdb/cli Cargo.toml
[ ] Update clients/ts/package.json version and clients/ts/src/index.ts CLIENT_VERSION
[ ] Update bindings/node/package.json version (@zvndev/powdb-embedded, lockstep)
[ ] Move CHANGELOG.md notes from Unreleased to the dated version entry
[ ] Update both the Next release and Current release lines in RELEASES.md
[ ] Run bash scripts/check-version-consistency.sh
[ ] Run bash scripts/smoke-package.sh (npm pack/import smoke + cargo package list)
[ ] Commit: "chore: release vX.Y.Z", open a PR, merge it

TAG BEFORE PUBLISHING. publish.yml refuses to publish unless the tag vX.Y.Z
already exists AND points at the exact commit being published, and it must be
dispatched on the tag. That guard is what stops an arbitrary branch shipping
under a released version number, so the crates cannot go first.

[ ] git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "..." && git push origin vX.Y.Z
    Pushing the tag triggers release.yml, which builds the binaries, publishes
    the multi-arch Docker image, and publishes @zvndev/powdb-client to npm
    token-less via OIDC. No manual npm publish for the client.
[ ] Publish the crates, dispatched ON THE TAG, in dependency order (the
    workflow already orders them: storage, auth, query, sync, backup, server,
    powdb, cli):

      gh workflow run publish.yml --ref vX.Y.Z -f version=X.Y.Z -f dry_run=false

    `dry_run` defaults to TRUE on purpose, so it must be spelled out or nothing
    publishes. A dry run is NOT a useful rehearsal here: it fails by design for
    every crate that depends on a workspace version not yet on crates.io.
[ ] Publish the embedded Node addon: run publish-node-addon.yml with
    dry_run=true to validate the full platform matrix, then re-run with
    dry_run=false to publish @zvndev/powdb-embedded (token-less, provenance).
    Unlike publish.yml, this dry run IS meaningful: it packs every platform and
    needs no OIDC setup. Do this BEFORE the smoke, which installs the addon.
[ ] Smoke-test the LIVE registries: run post-publish-smoke.yml with the
    released version (`gh workflow run post-publish-smoke.yml -f version=X.Y.Z`).
    It cargo-installs powdb-cli + powdb-server from crates.io and reruns the
    durability smoke (README PowQL flow + kill -9/restart WAL replay; the gate
    v0.4.1-v0.4.3 lacked), then npm-installs @zvndev/powdb-client and
    @zvndev/powdb-embedded and exercises both
[ ] Verify each registry directly rather than trusting workflow exit codes:
    crates.io versions, `gh release view vX.Y.Z`, the ghcr tag list, and
    `npm view <pkg> version` for each npm package
```

A brand-new package or crate name cannot use Trusted Publishing for its FIRST
publish, because the registry only lets you configure a trusted publisher on a
name that already exists. Bootstrap it once by hand, then configure. See
docs/ci/trusted-publishing.md.
