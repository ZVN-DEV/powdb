# Changelog

All notable changes to PowDB will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.3.1] - 2026-05-18

### Added
- **LSN-tagged WAL replay** — pages carry monotonic LSNs; replay skips already-applied records, eliminating data duplication on crash recovery
- **CRC32 checksums on catalog.bin** — the catalog file now has integrity checking, matching WAL and btree index files
- **StorageError enum** — typed error handling for the storage crate (replaces raw `io::Result`)
- **Bounds validation on page slots** — `iter_page_slots` returns `None` for corrupt entries instead of panicking
- **Bounds checks on unsafe executor macros** — guards against UB from corrupt row data in `agg_int_loop!`/`agg_float_loop!`
- **Plaintext password warning** — server logs a loud warning when password auth is enabled without TLS
- **Pre-auth payload limit** — CONNECT messages capped at 4KB (was 64MB), blocking pre-auth memory exhaustion
- **67 new tests** — B+tree edge cases (27), buffer pool (12), catalog corruption (10), WAL CRC rejection (14), TLS connections (4)
- **Landing page** — static docs site in `site/` for GitHub Pages with benchmarks, getting started, PowQL reference
- **Docker image CI** — release workflow now pushes to ghcr.io/zvndev/powdb on tag
- **Crates.io publish workflow** — `workflow_dispatch` for automated cargo publish in dependency order
- **Dependabot** — weekly checks for cargo, npm, and GitHub Actions dependencies
- **MSRV declared** — `rust-version = "1.75"` in workspace Cargo.toml
- **Crate-level `//!` docs** on query and server crates

### Fixed
- Flaky `connection_management` tests — replaced hand-rolled temp dirs with `tempfile::tempdir()`
- `// SAFETY:` comments on all unsafe blocks in storage and query crates

### Changed
- Updated SECURITY.md with TLS documentation, supported versions, auth mechanisms
- Updated benchmark numbers to latest run
- Added CHANGELOG entry for v0.3.0
- GitHub repo topics added for discoverability

## [0.3.0] - 2026-05-18

### Added

- **DDL WAL replay**: schema mutations (CREATE TABLE, DROP TABLE, ADD COLUMN,
  DROP COLUMN) are now logged to the WAL with record types 6-9. Crash recovery
  replays DDL operations idempotently — if the table/column already exists or
  was already dropped, replay skips gracefully. WAL records are flushed
  immediately before filesystem mutations for durability.
- **CRC32 checksums on B+ tree nodes**: every serialized B+ tree node now
  includes a CRC32 checksum (last 4 bytes), verified on load. Returns
  `io::Error(InvalidData)` on mismatch, protecting against silent corruption of
  index data on disk.
- `TypeId::from_u8()` convenience method on storage types.
- Doc-tests added across lexer, parser, executor, and storage modules.

### Fixed

- **Compiled predicates**: bounds-checked `CompiledLeaf::eval()` — no panics on
  corrupt row data.
- Bounds checks in sort+limit fast path and mmap heap scan slot directory reads.
- UTF-8 slicing bug found by fuzzer: `&s[..20]` replaced with
  `&s[..s.floor_char_boundary(20)]` in token display.
- Clippy `collapsible_if` lint in connection management tests.

### CI

- Added Miri job (scoped to non-mmap modules: btree, page, row, types, tx,
  view).
- Added AddressSanitizer job (hard gate, leak detection disabled for mmap
  regions).
- Fixed fuzz workflow `cargo-fuzz` install (removed `--locked` to avoid stale
  transitive deps).
- Updated required status check names in branch protection.

## [TS client 0.3.3] - 2026-05-10

### Fixed

- Report intentional protocol truncation errors for malformed short
  `ResultRows` and `ResultOk` frames instead of surfacing raw Node buffer
  range errors.

### Changed

- Pin local package-manager metadata to `pnpm@10.29.3` so audit and install
  tooling match the v9 lockfile used by the TypeScript client workspace.

## [TS client 0.3.1] - 2026-05-09

### Fixed

- Added Ping/Pong protocol support — client auto-replies Pong on server
  health check Ping frames instead of throwing "unknown message type"

## [0.2.0] - 2026-05-09

### Security

- Fixed path traversal vulnerability via table names
- Added TLS support for encrypted connections
- Added authentication rate limiting
- Added row size validation to prevent u16 overflow corruption
- Replaced unsafe UTF-8 decoding with safe alternative

### Added

- CLI meta-commands: `.tables`, `.schema`, `.timing`, `.help`, `.quit`
- Tab completion for PowQL keywords
- Persistent command history
- Query timing display
- Health check (Ping/Pong) protocol message
- Cross join and sort row count safety limits
- String literal size limit (16 MB)
- `--version` flag for CLI and server binaries
- `cargo install powdb-cli` / `cargo install powdb-server` install path

### Fixed

- Version strings now use Cargo.toml version instead of hardcoded "0.1.0"
- NULL values display as "NULL" instead of "{}"
- UUID values display in full standard format
- B-tree load validates file size to prevent OOM
- mmap slot access validates bounds

### Changed

- README repositioned around compiled predicates and PowQL ergonomics
- Server `--password` flag removed (use `POWDB_PASSWORD` env var)
- Human-readable error messages in parser
- PowQL docs updated with math, date/time, window functions, CAST, EXPLAIN, UPSERT

## [TS client 0.3.0] - 2026-04-16

TypeScript client (`@zvndev/powdb-client`) production-readiness release.
Server is unaffected — this is a client-only version bump. No breaking
changes to the 0.2.x API surface; all additions are additive.

### Added

- **Structured errors**: every error thrown by the client is now a
  `PowDBError` with a stable `.code` (`connect_failed`, `auth_failed`,
  `query_failed`, `aborted`, `size_exceeded`, `protocol_error`, `closed`,
  `timeout`, `type_coercion_failed`). Callers can branch on `.code` without
  string-matching messages. `isPowDBError(err)` narrows `unknown` for use
  in catch blocks.
- **Typed rows**: `client.queryTyped(query, schema, opts?)` coerces the
  server's string wire format into JS values using a caller-supplied
  schema (`int`, `float`, `bool`, `str`, `datetime`, `uuid`). Int values
  that exceed `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER` are promoted to `bigint`;
  datetime microseconds are converted via `BigInt` division to avoid
  float precision loss at year-2262 boundaries. Bytes columns are
  intentionally unsupported until the wire protocol grows a binary type.
- **Polling watch**: `client.watch(query, { intervalMs, onRows, onError?,
  stopOnError? })` re-runs a query on an interval and delivers rows to a
  callback. Guards against pile-up when a query is slower than the
  interval; returns `{ stop() }` to cancel. Uses `handle.unref()` so the
  watcher doesn't keep the event loop alive on its own.
- **Observability hooks**: `Client` now extends `EventEmitter`. Emits
  `"query"` (with `{ query, durationMs, ok, kind?, error? }`) after every
  query and `"close"` (with `{ error }`) exactly once per socket. Designed
  to be dropped into OpenTelemetry, pino, or a Prometheus exporter.
- **Pool connect retries**: `Pool` now retries transient connect-phase
  failures (`connect_failed`, `timeout`) with exponential backoff. New
  options: `connectRetries` (default 3), `connectBackoffMs` (default
  100), `connectMaxBackoffMs` (default 2_000). Auth failures, size
  violations, and other non-transient errors are never retried — they'd
  just fail the same way.

### Changed

- All raw `Error` throws in the client have been replaced with
  `PowDBError`. Existing `instanceof Error` checks still work; new code
  should prefer `instanceof PowDBError` + `.code` branching.

## [TS client 0.2.0] - 2026-04-16

TypeScript client (`@zvndev/powdb-client`) hardening release. Server is
unaffected — this is a client-only version bump.

### Added

- **Safe query composition**: new `powql` tagged template plus `escapeLiteral`,
  `escapeIdent`, and `ident()` helpers. The tagged template escapes literals
  and validates identifiers, neutralising PowQL-injection attacks (the same
  class of issue as SQL injection).
- **Connection pool**: new `Pool` class with `acquire`/`release`/`withClient`,
  FIFO waiter queue, and `acquireTimeoutMs`.
- **TLS support**: `tls` option on `Client.connect` accepts `true` or a
  `tls.ConnectionOptions` object.
- **Cancellation**: `client.query(q, { signal })` accepts an `AbortSignal`;
  cancelling does not tear down the socket — the reply is discarded so other
  in-flight queries keep working.
- **Frame size limits**: decoder enforces `MAX_PAYLOAD_SIZE` (64 MiB),
  `MAX_ROWS` (10M), and `MAX_COLUMNS` (4096) matching the server.
- **Version check**: on connect, warns once per `host:port` if the server's
  major version differs from the client's.
- **TCP keepalive**: `setKeepAlive(true, 30_000)` enabled on every connection
  so dead peers are detected on idle sockets.

### Fixed

- **O(n²) receive buffer**: the previous `Buffer.concat` on every chunk caused
  quadratic CPU on large result sets. Replaced with a lazy chunk queue that
  only coalesces when needed to decode a frame.

### Changed

- Minimum Node.js version is now explicitly `>=18` (was previously implicit).

## [0.1.2] - 2026-04-16

Hardening release: all known fuzz-reachable panics in the query layer are now
errors, and the CI gate has been tightened with cargo-audit and blocking fuzz
smoke runs.

### Fixed

- **Lexer**: integer literals wider than `i64::MAX` now return `LexError`
  instead of panicking (#25, closes #24)
- **Parser**: unterminated projection/assignment/argument/type-decl bodies at
  EOF (`nn{`, `z{`, etc.) now return `ParseError` instead of panicking via
  out-of-bounds indexing (#25, closes #26)
- **Executor**: `ORDER BY` on an unknown column now returns an error instead
  of panicking (#22)

### Security

- Bumped `rustls-webpki` 0.103.10 → 0.103.12 to pick up fixes for
  RUSTSEC-2026-0098 / RUSTSEC-2026-0099 (name-constraint bypass) (#25)

### CI

- New `cargo audit` job on every PR — blocks merges on known advisories (#23)
- New fuzz smoke workflow: `fuzz_lexer`, `fuzz_parser`, `fuzz_roundtrip` each
  run 60s on PRs that touch the query front-end, and nightly at 07:00 UTC.
  Blocking on failure (#23, #25)

## [0.1.1] - 2026-04-14

Post-launch polish: TS client test coverage, engine bug fixes surfaced by
end-to-end testing, and documentation sync.

### Added

- **TS client**: 53 end-to-end tests covering DDL, insert, filter, projection,
  aggregates, joins, GROUP BY/HAVING, subqueries, updates, deletes, and error
  paths (#18)
- **AGENTS.md**: user-facing primer with PowQL-vs-SQL cheat sheet, footgun
  table, and performance notes for AI assistants and new users (#20)

### Fixed

- **Parser**: `= null` and `!= null` now desugar to `IS NULL` / `IS NOT NULL`
  instead of being rejected (#19)
- **Executor**: `HAVING` on post-projection group queries now filters groups
  correctly (#19)
- **Parser**: statements with trailing tokens (e.g. `User match T on ...`,
  `User create_index .col`) now error cleanly instead of silently parsing as a
  bare-source query and dropping the rest (#19)
- **Executor**: DDL statements (`alter ... add index`, `alter ... add column`,
  `alter ... drop column`) now return an affected-count result instead of an
  empty row set (#19)

### Changed

- **Docs**: `README.md`, `docs/getting-started.md`, and `docs/POWQL.md` updated
  to use current syntax everywhere — `alter T add index .col` (not
  `create_index`), `alter T add column` (not `add_column`), `sum(T { .x })`
  (not `sum(T | .x)`), and `T1 as a inner join T2 as b on ...` (not `match`) (#20)
